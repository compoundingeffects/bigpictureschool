## Logic

At its core, logic is the systematic study of valid reasoning - how we can move from what we know to be true to reach reliable conclusions about what else must be true. It's the foundation of rational thought.

**Truth Values**

The simplest logical concept is that of truth values - statements can be either true or false. This binary nature forms the basis of logical reasoning. For example, "This apple is red" must be either true or false.

**Propositions**

Moving up one level, we have propositions - statements that can be evaluated as true or false. These are the atoms of logical reasoning. A proposition like "All humans are mortal" can be analyzed for its truth value.

**Logical Operators**

To connect these basic propositions, we use logical operators - AND, OR, NOT, IF-THEN. These allow us to build more complex statements while preserving truth relationships. For instance, "IF it is raining, THEN the ground is wet" connects two propositions in a way that maintains logical consistency.

**Rules of Inference**

Building further, we establish rules of inference - patterns of reasoning that preserve truth. The most fundamental is modus ponens: if we know "IF A THEN B" is true, and we know "A" is true, we can conclude "B" must be true.

**Validity vs. Truth**

A crucial distinction emerges here: logical validity (the form of the argument) differs from truth (the content). A logically valid argument with true premises must lead to a true conclusion, but valid reasoning can still lead to false conclusions if it starts from false premises.

**Logical Systems**

From these foundations, we can construct entire systems of logic - frameworks for determining what conclusions necessarily follow from given premises. Classical logic, modal logic, and mathematical logic all build upon these basic principles in different ways.
