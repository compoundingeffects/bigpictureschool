## Life Science

1. **What is Life Science**? Life science is the study of living things and how they work. It tries to understand what life is, how it starts, how it functions, and how living things interact with their surroundings and each other.

2. **What is Life**? Life refers to things that can do certain activities:
- Use energy from their environment to stay alive (metabolism)
- Make more of themselves (reproduction)
- Get bigger and more complex over time (growth and development)
- React to changes around them (response to stimuli)
- Keep their internal conditions stable (homeostasis)
- Change over time to survive better in their environment (adaptation)

3. **What are Cells**? Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. They're like tiny factories made up of different parts (molecules) that work together. The main parts are proteins, fats, DNA/RNA, and sugars. Some cells have a central control center (nucleus), while others don't.

4. **What are Biochemical Molecules**? These are the chemical building blocks of life:
- **Proteins**: Do most of the work in cells, like speeding up chemical reactions and giving cells structure
- **DNA**: Stores the instructions for making proteins and guides how an organism develops and works
- **Lipids**: Fats and oils that make up cell walls and store energy
- **Carbohydrates**: Sugars that provide energy and structure

5. **What is Metabolism**? Metabolism is all the chemical reactions that happen in a living thing to keep it alive. It involves breaking down molecules to release energy and building up molecules to store energy. Cells use a special molecule called ATP as an energy source.

6. **What is DNA and Heredity**? DNA is like a recipe book for making proteins. It's made up of four chemical letters arranged in a specific order. When living things reproduce, they pass copies of their DNA to their offspring. Sometimes small changes (mutations) occur in the DNA, which can lead to new traits.

7. **What is Evolution**? Evolution is how species change over time. It happens because:
- There are differences between individuals in a population.
- Some individuals are better suited to their environment and survive longer.
- These better-suited individuals have more offspring.
- Over time, the helpful traits become more common in the population.

8. **Ecosystems and Interdependence**: Living things don't exist alone. They live in communities called ecosystems, where they interact with each other and their environment. These interactions include eating each other, helping each other, and competing for resources. The flow of energy and recycling of nutrients are important for keeping ecosystems balanced.

9. **How Life Science Works - The Scientific Method**: Life scientists use a step-by-step process to study living things:
    1. Notice something interesting.
    2. Come up with a possible explanation.
    3. Test the explanation through experiments.
    4. If the explanation holds up, it becomes a broader theory.
    5. Some well-established ideas become scientific laws.

10. **Fundamental Principles in Life Science**: Life science has discovered some basic rules about how life works:
- All living things are made of cells, and all cells come from other cells.
- Species change over time to better fit their environment.
- Information in cells flows from DNA to RNA to proteins.
- Traits are passed from parents to offspring in predictable ways.

These principles help explain how life works at all levels, from the tiniest parts of cells to entire ecosystems.
