## Physical Science

1. **Physical Science**: Physical science is the study of matter and energy and how they interact.

2. **Matter**: Everything you can touch or see is made of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space and has weight. Atoms are incredibly small particles that make up matter. They're made of even smaller parts called protons, neutrons, and electrons. When atoms join together, they form molecules. Different combinations of atoms and molecules create all the different materials we see in the world.

3. **Energy**: Energy is like the ability to do work or cause change. It comes in different forms, like the energy of movement, stored energy, heat, or light. The important thing to remember is that energy can't be created or destroyed â€“ it just changes from one form to another.

4. **Forces Govern Interactions**: Forces are pushes or pulls that make things move or stop moving. There are four main forces in nature: gravity (which makes things fall), electromagnetism (which involves electricity and magnets), and two forces that work inside atoms (the strong and weak nuclear forces). Newton's Laws of Motion are rules that explain how things move. They help us understand why objects start moving, keep moving, or stop moving when forces act on them.

5. **Space and Time**: Space is where everything exists, and time is how we measure when things happen. In physics, we think of space and time as being connected, calling it "spacetime." Relavity is an idea that says space and time can change depending on how fast you're moving or if you're near something very heavy like a planet. It means that what we see as space and time can be different for different people.

6. **Laws of Physics**: The laws of physics are rules that explain how the universe works. They apply everywhere and help us predict what will happen in different situations. Some important laws include those about motion, energy, heat, tiny particles, and light.

7. **Quantifying Change**: We use math to describe and measure changes in the physical world. This helps us make precise predictions about how things will behave. We measure different things to understand how they change:
- We measure distance, speed, and acceleration to understand movement.
- We measure energy, work, and power to understand how energy moves and changes.
- We measure pressure, volume, and temperature to understand the state of gases, liquids, and solids.

Physical science is all about understanding how matter, energy, forces, space, and time work together following universal rules. These basic ideas help us explain everything from how galaxies move to how the tiniest particles behave.
