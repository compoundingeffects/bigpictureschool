# **Performing Arts**

1. **Core Purpose**: The main goal of performing arts is to express ourselves as humans. It's about sharing ideas, feelings, stories, or important beliefs with other people. When someone performs, they're trying to make the audience feel something, think about something, or appreciate something beautiful.
2. **Essential Elements**
* **Human Performers**: Performers are the people who do the actual performing. They might be actors, dancers, singers, or musicians. We need performers because without them, there wouldn't be a performance. All humans can perform in some way because we all have bodies we can move, voices we can use, and the ability to express ourselves.
* **Action or Movement**: Performing means doing something. This could be dancing, singing, speaking, or playing an instrument. These actions are important because they're how performers communicate their message. We can do these things because of how our bodies work and the basic laws of physics (like how we make sounds or move our bodies).
* **Audience**: An audience is the group of people watching or listening to the performance. Without an audience, a performance wouldn't really be complete. The audience is important because they react to what they see or hear, which is the whole point of performing. As humans, we naturally respond to things other people do, so being an audience member comes naturally to us.
* **Time and Space**: Every performance happens at a specific time and in a specific place. This could be on a stage, in a concert hall, or even online. Time and space matter because they set the boundaries for the performance. Everything that happens, happens within a certain amount of time and in a certain place – that's just how our world works.
* **Story, Emotion, or Idea**: A performance needs to have something to communicate. This could be a story with a beginning, middle, and end. It could be a feeling like happiness or sadness. Or it could be an idea or concept. This content is what gives the performance its meaning. As humans, we're naturally good at understanding and sharing stories and feelings – it's how we make sense of the world.
3. **How the Elements Interact**
* Performers use their bodies and voices to share a message with the audience. This all happens at a specific time and place.
* The audience watches the performance and tries to understand it. Even if they're quiet, their presence affects how the performers perform. It's like a back-and-forth between the performers and the audience.
* The message being shared in the performance is influenced by many things, like the performer's culture or personal experiences. This message is expressed through the performer's movements, words, or sounds.
4. **Conclusion**: When we break it down to its simplest parts, performing arts is really just a special way for humans to express themselves. It relies on our basic abilities to move, speak, and make others feel emotions. It happens in a shared space with an audience. The whole system works because, as social creatures, humans communicate through actions and reactions. This is the most basic way to understand performing arts: it's a way of communicating using our bodies to make others respond in some way.
