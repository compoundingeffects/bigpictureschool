# Humanities

## What are the humanities?

The humanities are fields of study that explore human culture, experience, and creativity. In simple terms, these subjects investigate what makes us uniquely human by looking at our languages, art, history, philosophy, and the many ways we express ourselves and organize our societies.

## Building from the basics

To understand the humanities, let's start with some basic observations about human nature.

**We're creatures who create meaning.** Unlike other animals, humans build complicated systems of symbols and meanings to make sense of our experiences. Think about it: we invented language, created art, developed religions, and built philosophical systems—all to help us understand and share what we're going through. This drive to find and create meaning is at the heart of what humanities studies.

**Culture is how we adapt and survive.** Most species adapt to their environment through biological evolution—a process that takes thousands of years. Humans are different. We adapt by creating and sharing culture. We pass down knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next through teaching, stories, books, and institutions like schools. This cultural sharing happens much faster than biological evolution and gives us remarkable flexibility.

**We seek more than just survival.** Once humans meet our basic needs for food, water, and shelter, we don't stop there. We consistently look for purpose, beauty, truth, and connection with others. This search leads us to create art, write poetry, build monuments, develop philosophies, and ask big questions about why we're here. The humanities study all these creative and intellectual products.

## What the humanities include

Based on these fundamental ideas, the humanities cover several connected areas.

**Language and literature** look at how we use words to create meaning, preserve what we know, and express complex feelings and ideas. When you read a novel, poem, or play, you're experiencing humanity's attempt to capture and share the full range of what it means to be human.

**History** investigates how human societies grow, change, and learn from their past. By studying history, we can spot patterns in how people behave and make decisions across different times and places.

**Philosophy** tackles the big questions that arise from human consciousness and our ability to reason: What exists? How do we know what we know? What's right and wrong? What does life mean?

**The arts**—including painting, sculpture, music, theater, and dance—let us express and communicate experiences that go beyond what words alone can capture.

**Religious and cultural studies** explore the belief systems and practices that communities create to answer life's biggest questions and organize how people live together.

## Why the humanities matter

The humanities serve crucial purposes in our lives and society. These fields preserve and pass down cultural knowledge from one generation to the next. They help us develop critical thinking skills—the ability to analyze, question, and understand complex ideas. They give us tools for making sense of complicated human experiences, whether in our own lives or in distant times and places.

When you study the humanities, you learn to navigate ethical dilemmas, appreciate different perspectives, and connect your own experience to the broader human story. These aren't just academic exercises—they're essential skills for being an informed citizen, making good ethical decisions, and maintaining the cultural connections that help define who we are as a civilization.

Unlike the sciences, which aim to understand, control, and predict natural phenomena, the humanities focus on understanding, interpreting, and preserving the rich variety of human experience and achievement. Both approaches are valuable, but they serve different purposes. The humanities remind us of where we've been, help us understand where we are, and give us perspective as we decide where we're going.
