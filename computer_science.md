## Computer Science

1. **What is computer science**? Computer science is about studying how we can use machines to handle information. It looks at how we can do calculations, store data, and send messages using step-by-step instructions and organized ways of keeping information.

2. **What is computation**? Computation is like following a recipe. It's about doing math or following instructions to solve problems. It takes information you put in and changes it into a result. The main ideas in computation are:
    - **Algorithms**: Algorithms are like detailed recipes that tell you exactly what to do to solve a problem.
    - **Turing machines**: Turing machines are imaginary machines that can solve any problem by reading and writing symbols based on rules. They help us understand what computers can do.
    - **Logical operations**: Logical operations are simple actions like "and," "or," and "not" that computers use to make decisions and process information.

3. **What is information**? Information is data that means something. It's measured in bits, which are like tiny on/off switches (1 or 0). We can combine these to make more complex information. Important ideas about information include:
    - **Data structures**: Data structures are ways to organize information so computers can use it easily, like lists or trees.
    - **Encoding**: Encoding is how we turn information into a format computers can understand, like changing letters into numbers.
    - **Information theory**: This area of study looks at how we can measure, store, and send information.

4. **What is an algorithm**? An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem or do a task. It's like a very detailed recipe. Some important things about algorithms are:
    - **Sorting and searching**: Sorting and searching are common tasks that algorithms do, like putting things in order or finding something in a list.
    - **Time complexity**: Time complexity measures how long an algorithm takes as the amount of information grows.
    - **Efficiency**: Efficiency is about finding the best way to solve a problem using the least time and resources.

5. **What is a computer**? A computer is a machine that follows instructions to process information. It has:
    - **Hardware**: The physical parts, like the brain (CPU), memory, and storage.
    - **Software**: The instructions that tell the computer what to do.
    - **Binary system**: The language computers use, which is just 1s and 0s.

6. **Programming languages**: Programming languages are special languages we use to give instructions to computers. They help humans talk to machines more easily. Some key points:
    - **Syntax and semantics**: Syntax is like grammar for the language, and semantics is what the instructions mean.
    - **High-level vs. low-Level languages**: High-level languages are easier for humans to understand, while low-level languages are closer to what the machine understands.
    - **Compilation and interpretation**: Compilation and interpretation are ways to turn human-written code into instructions the computer can understand.

7. **Theory of computation**: This area studies what computers can do and how efficiently they can do it. It includes:
    - **Computability theory**: Computability theory looks at what problems can be solved by computers and what problems are too hard.
    - **Complexity theory**: Complexity theory studies how much time and memory different problems need to be solved.
    - **Automata theory**: Automata theory explores simple models of computers to understand what they can do.

8. **Building systems - software engineering**: Software engineering is about designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It involves:
    - **Development methodologies**: Development methodologies are ways to organize the work of building software.
    - **Design patterns**: Design patterns are tried-and-true solutions to common problems in software design.
    - **Testing and debugging**: Testing and debugging are ways to check if the software works correctly and fix it if it doesn't.

In summary, computer science is about figuring out how machines can handle, keep, and share information by following step-by-step instructions.
