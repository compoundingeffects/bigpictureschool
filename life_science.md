## Life Science

Life science is the systematic study of living organisms and biological processes—examining how life emerges, functions, reproduces, and evolves. It encompasses biology, ecology, genetics, biochemistry, and related fields, unified by the goal of understanding what distinguishes living systems from non-living matter.

## Building from First Principles

**What is life?** Starting with observation, we notice certain systems exhibit properties that non-living matter typically doesn't: they maintain organization against entropy, respond to their environment, grow, reproduce, and change over time. Life appears to be matter organized in specific ways that create these emergent behaviors.

**What are the basic requirements?** All living systems need energy input to maintain their organization, a boundary that separates inside from outside, and mechanisms to store and transmit information. This leads us to recognize that life is fundamentally about information processing and energy management within organized matter.

**What are the minimal components?** Breaking down to the simplest level, all known life shares certain features: cells as basic units, carbon-based chemistry, DNA/RNA for information storage, and proteins for structure and function. These appear to be the minimal toolkit for creating living systems.

**How does complexity build up?** Simple chemical reactions, when organized into networks, can create self-sustaining cycles. Molecules interact to form cells. Cells cooperate to form tissues, organs, and organisms. Organisms interact to form ecosystems. Each level exhibits properties not present at lower levels.

**How does information flow?** Living systems store information in DNA, express it through RNA, and implement it via proteins. This information gets copied, modified, and passed down through generations. Errors in copying create variation, which drives evolution.

**What drives change over time?** Organisms that successfully reproduce pass on their traits. Those less successful leave fewer offspring. This differential reproduction, operating on inherited variation, naturally leads to adaptation and evolution over time.

**How do living systems maintain order?** Unlike non-living systems that tend toward disorder, living organisms actively maintain their organization by constantly consuming energy and materials from their environment. They are open systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

**What governs interactions?** Chemical principles explain how molecules interact within cells. Physical principles govern how organisms move and exchange energy. Mathematical principles describe population dynamics and evolutionary change.

This first-principles approach reveals life science as the study of how physical and chemical processes can be organized to create self-maintaining, reproducing, and evolving systems—essentially understanding how matter becomes alive.
