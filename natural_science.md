# **Natural Science**

1. **Natural Science**: Natural science is the study of everything in our physical world. Scientists observe things, do experiments, and use reasoning to figure out how the universe works.

2. **The basic ideas behind natural science are**:

    - **Reality exists**: There's a real world out there, made of stuff like matter and energy, existing in space and time. This world follows rules that we can figure out.

    - **We can observe reality**: We can use our senses, or tools like microscopes, to gather information about the world around us. This information is called "empirical data."

    - **Cause and effect**: Everything that happens (an effect) has something that made it happen (a cause). The universe works in a way we can understand by finding these connections.

    - **Laws of nature**: There are consistent rules that describe how things behave. For example, there are rules about how things move or how energy changes form. Scientists discover these rules, not invent them.

    - **Breaking things down**: To understand complex things, scientists often break them into simpler parts. For instance, to understand living things, we might look at cells, then molecules, then atoms.

3. **Scientists use these basic ideas to guide their work**:

    - They break down complicated things into simpler parts to understand them better. For example, to understand life, they might start with cells, then look at the chemical reactions in cells, then at the atoms involved in those reactions.

    - They come up with ideas (hypotheses) based on these basic principles and then test these ideas with experiments.

    - They often use math to describe the rules they find in nature. For example, Einstein's famous equation E = mcÂ² describes how energy and mass are related.

4. **Different areas of natural science build on each other**:

    - Physics studies the most basic rules of matter, energy, space, and time.
    - Chemistry, which is based on physics, looks at how atoms and molecules interact.
    - Biology, which is based on chemistry, studies living things and how they work.
    - Earth and space sciences study big things like planets and galaxies, using ideas from physics, chemistry, and biology.

In summary, natural science tries to understand our world by observing it, finding cause-and-effect relationships, and discovering the rules that apply to everything from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies. Scientists start with the most basic ideas and build up to explain more complex things.
