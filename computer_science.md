## Computer Science

1. **What is computer science**? Computer science is about studying how we can use machines to handle information. It looks at how we can do calculations, store data, and send messages using step-by-step instructions and organized ways of keeping information.

2. **What is computation**? Computation is like following a recipe. It's about doing math or following instructions to solve problems. It takes information you put in and changes it into a result. The main ideas in computation are:
    - **Algorithms**: These are like detailed recipes that tell you exactly what to do to solve a problem.
    - **Turing machines**: These are imaginary machines that can solve any problem by reading and writing symbols based on rules. They help us understand what computers can do.
    - **Logical operations**: These are simple actions like "and," "or," and "not" that computers use to make decisions and process information.

3. **What is information**? Information is data that means something. It's measured in bits, which are like tiny on/off switches (1 or 0). We can combine these to make more complex information. Important ideas about information include:
    - **Data structures**: These are ways to organize information so computers can use it easily, like lists or trees.
    - **Encoding**: This is how we turn information into a format computers can understand, like changing letters into numbers.
    - **Information theory**: This area of study looks at how we can measure, store, and send information.

4. **What is an algorithm**? An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem or do a task. It's like a very detailed recipe. Some important things about algorithms are:
    - **Sorting and searching**: These are common tasks that algorithms do, like putting things in order or finding something in a list.
    - **Time complexity**: This measures how long an algorithm takes as the amount of information grows.
    - **Efficiency**: This is about finding the best way to solve a problem using the least time and resources.

5. **What is a computer**? A computer is a machine that follows instructions to process information. It has:
    - **Hardware**: The physical parts, like the brain (CPU), memory, and storage.
    - **Software**: The instructions that tell the computer what to do.
    - **Binary system**: The language computers use, which is just 1s and 0s.

6. **Programming languages**: These are special languages we use to give instructions to computers. They help humans talk to machines more easily. Some key points:
    - **Syntax and semantics**: Syntax is like grammar for the language, and semantics is what the instructions mean.
    - **High-level vs. low-Level languages**: High-level languages are easier for humans to understand, while low-level languages are closer to what the machine understands.
    - **Compilation and interpretation**: These are ways to turn human-written code into instructions the computer can understand.

7. **Theory of computation**: This area studies what computers can do and how efficiently they can do it. It includes:
    - **Computability theory**: This looks at what problems can be solved by computers and what problems are too hard.
    - **Complexity theory**: This studies how much time and memory different problems need to be solved.
    - **Automata theory**: This explores simple models of computers to understand what they can do.

8. **Building systems - software engineering**: This is about making large, complex software systems. It involves:
    - **Development methodologies**: These are ways to organize the work of building software.
    - **Design patterns**: These are tried-and-true solutions to common problems in software design.
    - **Testing and debugging**: These are ways to check if the software works correctly and fix it if it doesn't.

In summary, computer science is about understanding how we can use machines to handle information in all sorts of ways, from simple calculations to complex systems that can process vast amounts of data.
