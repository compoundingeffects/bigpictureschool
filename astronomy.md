## Astronomy

1. **What is astronomy**? Astronomy is the study of everything in space beyond Earth's atmosphere. This includes stars, planets, galaxies, and the entire universe. It's about understanding what these space objects are and how they behave.

2. **What are celestial objects made of**? Everything in the universe is made of matter and energy. Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms, which are built from even smaller parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Energy comes in different forms, like light, heat, and the energy of gravity. Stars, planets, and galaxies are just big collections of matter and energy interacting in various ways.

3. **Why do celestial objects move and interact**? Objects in space move and interact because of basic forces of nature:
- Gravity pulls things together. It's why planets orbit stars and moons orbit planets.
- Electromagnetic force is responsible for how light travels through space. This lets us study far-away objects by looking at their light.
- Nuclear forces work inside stars, making smaller atoms join to form bigger ones. This process powers stars and creates heavier elements.

4. **How do we study astronomy**? Since we can't touch or visit most things in space, we study them in two main ways:
- We look at the light from space objects. Light tells us what things are made of, how they're moving, and how far away they are.
- We use math to describe how things in space behave and to predict what they'll do next.

5. **What basic processes govern celestial objects**? A few key processes explain how most things in space work:
- Stars create energy by smashing small atoms together to make bigger ones (nuclear fusion).
- Planets and moons follow curved paths (orbits) around stars or planets because of gravity.
- The whole universe is expanding, with galaxies moving away from each other.

6. **How do we know distances in space**? Measuring distances in space is tricky, but we have a few clever methods:
- We look at how nearby stars seem to shift position as Earth moves around the Sun (parallax).
- We use special types of stars that have a known brightness as reference points to measure distances to farther objects.

7. **Summary**:
- Everything in space is made of tiny particles that interact through basic forces like gravity.
- Light is our main source of information about space objects.
- Gravity controls how big things in space move and are arranged.
- We study space by looking at light with telescopes and using math.
- The same basic rules that apply on Earth (like gravity and how energy works) also apply to everything in space.
