    - Value creation is like making that delicious sandwich. It's the most important part of any business.
    - Needs and wants are simply what drives people to buy things. Like being hungry drives you to buy that sandwich.

- **How is Value Created?** Creating value is like cooking. You take ingredients (resources), follow a recipe (processes), and make a meal (product or service) that people want to buy. Here's what goes into this:
    1. **Resources**: These are your ingredients. It could be physical stuff, people's work, money, technology, or knowledge.
    2. **Processes**: This is your recipe. It's how you combine your ingredients to make your product.
    3. **Innovation**: This is like coming up with a new recipe or finding a better way to cook. It's about improving how you do things.

    Businesses try to use their ingredients wisely and come up with new recipes to keep making good stuff that people want.
