# Cosmology

Cosmology represents the scientific study of the universe as a whole system, examining its origin, evolution, structure, and ultimate fate. This field operates at the largest possible scales, treating the entire observable universe as a single object of investigation.

## Fundamental Observational Starting Points

The foundation of cosmological thinking begins with direct observations that require explanation. We observe that the night sky appears dark despite containing billions of stars, a phenomenon known as Olbers' paradox. We detect that distant galaxies exhibit systematic redshift in their light spectra, with more distant objects showing greater redshift. We measure a uniform background radiation permeating all of space at approximately 2.7 Kelvin above absolute zero.

These observations demand theoretical frameworks to explain their existence and characteristics.

## The Cosmological Principle

From first principles, cosmology adopts a fundamental assumption about the universe's structure: the cosmological principle. This states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, meaning it appears the same in all directions and locations when viewed from any point. This principle emerges from both observational evidence and the philosophical requirement that our location in the universe should not be special or privileged.

## Spacetime as the Fundamental Framework

Einstein's general relativity provides the theoretical foundation for modern cosmology by describing gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime itself. Matter and energy curve spacetime, and this curvature determines how objects move through space and time. At cosmological scales, the distribution of matter and energy determines the overall geometry and evolution of the universe.

## The Expanding Universe Model

The systematic redshift of distant galaxies indicates that space itself expands uniformly. This expansion does not represent objects moving through space, but rather the stretching of space between objects. The rate of this expansion, described by Hubble's constant, provides a direct measurement of how the universe evolves over time.

## Cosmic Evolution Through Time

Working backward from current observations using the expansion rate, cosmology concludes that the universe existed in an extremely hot, dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This initial condition, termed the Big Bang, represents the beginning of both space and time as we understand them. The universe has since expanded and cooled, allowing the formation of atomic nuclei, neutral atoms, stars, and larger structures.

## The Role of Dark Components

Observational evidence reveals that ordinary matter comprises only a small fraction of the universe's total content. Dark matter, which interacts gravitationally but not electromagnetically, accounts for approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy. Dark energy, responsible for accelerating the universe's expansion, constitutes roughly 68% of the total. These components remain poorly understood but are essential for explaining observed cosmic phenomena.

## Structural Formation

The universe's current structure of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and cosmic voids emerged from tiny density fluctuations in the early universe. These fluctuations, amplified by gravitational attraction over billions of years, created the cosmic web of matter we observe today. The cosmic microwave background radiation preserves an image of these primordial fluctuations.

## Methodological Approach

Cosmology employs both theoretical modeling and observational astronomy to test hypotheses about the universe's behavior. Large-scale surveys map the distribution of galaxies across space and time, while precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background provide detailed information about the universe's early conditions and composition.

This first-principles approach reveals cosmology as a field that seeks to understand the universe's most fundamental properties through careful observation, mathematical modeling, and the application of known physical laws to extreme conditions of scale, density, and temperature.
