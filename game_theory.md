## Game Theory

At its core, game theory is the study of strategic decision-making between rational actors. But to truly understand it, let's start with even more basic concepts.

What is a decision? A decision is a choice between different possible actions, where each action leads to different outcomes. When we make decisions that affect only ourselves, the analysis is relatively straightforward - we simply choose the action that gives us the best outcome according to our preferences.

But what happens when our decisions affect others, and their decisions affect us? This is where game theory begins. Imagine two companies deciding whether to lower their prices. Each company's best outcome depends not just on their own action, but on what the other company does. This interdependence of decisions is the first fundamental principle of game theory.

The second fundamental principle is rationality. In game theory, we assume that each player acts to maximize their own benefit or "utility." This doesn't mean players are selfish - their utility might include benefits to others. But it does mean they act logically to achieve their goals.

From these two principles - interdependent decisions and rational actors - we can derive the concept of strategic thinking. Players must consider not just what they want to do, but what others will do, knowing that others are thinking the same way. This leads to the idea of equilibrium - a situation where each player's strategy is optimal given what others are doing.

Let's make this concrete with a simple example: Two prisoners are being interrogated separately (the famous Prisoner's Dilemma). Each has two choices: stay silent or betray the other. If both stay silent, they each get 1 year in prison. If both betray, they each get 3 years. If one betrays while the other stays silent, the betrayer goes free while the silent one gets 5 years.

Think about how you would analyze this situation. First, consider what's best for you if the other prisoner stays silent. In this case, betraying (0 years) is better than staying silent (1 year). What if the other prisoner betrays? Again, betraying (3 years) is better than staying silent (5 years). Therefore, regardless of what the other prisoner does, betraying is your best strategy. This is called a dominant strategy.

But since both prisoners think this way, they both betray and end up with 3 years each - worse than if they had both stayed silent. This illustrates another key principle: individual rationality can lead to collective irrationality.

From these foundations, game theory builds up to analyze more complex situations: games with many players, repeated interactions, incomplete information, and changing circumstances. Each adds new layers of strategic complexity while still building on the same fundamental principles of interdependent decisions and rational behavior.
