# **Formal Science**

1. **What is formal science**? Formal science is the study of abstract systems that aren't tied to the physical world. It uses logic, mathematics, and theoretical ideas to explore patterns, structures, and relationships. Think of it as the foundation for other sciences, providing the tools and language needed for careful analysis.

2. **What is logic**? Logic is like the rules of thinking. It helps us figure out if an argument makes sense or not. There are different types of logic:
- Propositional logic deals with simple statements that are either true or false.
- Predicate logic is more complex, using variables and words like "all" or "some."
- Inference rules are like the steps we follow to reach a conclusion based on what we already know.

3. **What is mathematics**? Mathematics is all about numbers, shapes, and patterns. It's a key part of formal science because it lets us describe abstract ideas precisely. It includes:
- Numbers, which represent quantities (like counting apples).
- Algebra, which is about using symbols and rules to solve problems.
- Geometry, which studies shapes and their properties.
- Set theory, which looks at collections of objects and how they relate to each other.

4. **What are abstract systems**? An abstract system is like a made-up world with its own objects and rules. Unlike the real world, these systems exist only in our minds or on paper. They often use math or logic to describe how things work within the system.

5. **The role of proof**: In formal science, a proof is a way to show that something is true within a system. It uses logic and previously established truths to build an argument. This ensures that conclusions drawn from formal systems are always valid within that system.

6. **Core disciplines of formal science**: Formal science includes several main areas:
    - **Mathematics**: This is about studying numbers, structures, and patterns. It includes topics like algebra (studying mathematical structures), analysis (studying change and motion), and topology (studying space and continuous transformations).
    - **Logic**: This is about studying valid reasoning. It includes propositional logic (dealing with simple statements), predicate logic (dealing with objects and their relations), and modal logic (exploring different modes of truth like possibility and necessity).
    - **Computer science**: This field, especially theoretical computer science, looks at algorithms, data structures, and theories of computation. It asks questions like "What can be computed?" and "How efficiently can we solve problems?"
    - **Statistics**: This area deals with collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. It helps us understand randomness and uncertainty in a mathematical way.
    - **Game theory**: This field studies situations where people (or players) make decisions that affect each other. It tries to understand the best strategies in competitive or cooperative situations.

7. **The scientific method in formal science**: Even though formal science deals with abstract ideas, it still follows a kind of scientific method:
- First, it starts with some basic truths (axioms) that are accepted without proof.
- Then, it uses these axioms to define rules and relationships.
- Finally, it uses rigorous logical reasoning to prove new facts (theorems) based on these rules and axioms.

In summary, formal science steps away from the real world to look at the basic rules and connections that make up logical and mathematical systems.
