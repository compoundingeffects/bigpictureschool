## Astronomy

1. **Astronomy**: Astronomy is the study of everything in space beyond Earth's atmosphere. This includes stars, planets, galaxies, and the entire universe. The goal is to understand what these things are, how they came to be, and how they change over time.

2. **Celestial objects**: These are the things we find in space. Stars are big balls of hot gas that make their own light and energy. Planets are smaller objects that go around stars but don't make their own light. Moons are even smaller and orbit planets. Galaxies are huge groups of stars, gas, and dust all held together by gravity. Nebulae are clouds of gas and dust where stars are born or die.

3. **Light in astronomy**: Light is super important in astronomy because it's how we learn about things in space. Light is a kind of energy that travels really fast - about 300,000 kilometers every second. It can act like both a wave and a tiny particle called a photon. There are different types of light, like the kind we can see, infrared (which we feel as heat), and X-rays. Astronomers use special tools called telescopes to study all these types of light from space objects.

4. **Gravity**: Gravity is a force that makes things pull towards each other. The more stuff (or mass) something has, the stronger its gravity. Gravity is why planets orbit around stars and why galaxies stick together. Einstein explained gravity as big objects bending space itself, kind of like a heavy ball on a trampoline makes a dip that smaller balls roll into.

5. **Space and time**: Space is the big, empty area where everything exists. It's so big that we measure distances in light-years - how far light travels in a whole year. Time in space is tricky because light takes time to reach us. When we look at faraway stars, we're actually seeing them as they were in the past. Space and time are actually connected, forming something called space-time.

6. **The universe**: The universe is everything that exists - all the space, time, matter, and energy. It started about 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, when everything was squished into a tiny point and then suddenly expanded. The universe is still getting bigger today, which we can see by how distant galaxies are moving away from us.

7. **Building blocks of the universe**: The universe is made up of three main things: ordinary matter (the stuff we can see and touch), dark matter (a mysterious substance we can't see but can detect through its gravity), and dark energy (a weird form of energy making the universe expand faster).

8. **Studying astronomy**: Astronomers use different tools to learn about space. Telescopes collect light from far away to help us see distant objects. They also use a technique called spectroscopy to figure out what space objects are made of by studying their light. Sometimes, we send spacecraft and probes into space to get a closer look at planets and other objects.

In simple terms, astronomy is about understanding everything in space by looking at how gravity affects objects, studying the light they give off, and thinking about how space and time work together. It's a big puzzle that scientists are always trying to solve, from figuring out how stars are born to guessing what might happen to the whole universe in the future.
