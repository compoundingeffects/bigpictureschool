# **Applied Sciences**

1. **What is Science?** Science is basically a way of learning about the world around us. It's like being a detective, but instead of solving crimes, you're solving mysteries about nature. Here's how it works:
* First, you look closely at things happening in nature. This is called observation. It's like noticing that apples always fall down, not up.
* Then, you come up with ideas about why things happen the way they do. These ideas are called hypotheses. For example, you might think, "Maybe there's some force pulling apples towards the ground."
* To test if your idea is right, you do experiments. This is like dropping different objects to see if they all fall down too.
* Finally, if your idea seems to be correct based on your experiments, you try to explain it in a way that makes sense and could apply to other similar situations. This explanation is called a theory.

2. **What are Applied Sciences?** Applied sciences are about taking what we've learned through science and using it to solve real-world problems. It's like taking the recipe you've learned and actually cooking a meal. Here's what that involves:
* You start with the knowledge gained from basic sciences like physics, chemistry, or biology. This is like having the ingredients and knowing how they work together.
* Then, you use this knowledge to create something useful or to make something better. For example, understanding how electricity works (physics) could help you design a better light bulb.
* The main goal is to solve specific problems people face in their daily lives. It's not just about knowing things, but about using that knowledge to make life easier or better.

3. **Understanding Applied Sciences**: To really get what applied sciences are about, we can break it down to its most basic parts:
* The main purpose is to create practical solutions. It's about making things that work in the real world, not just in theory.
* The process usually starts with a problem. Then, you use what you know from science to understand the problem better and come up with a solution. It's often a trial-and-error process. You might come up with a solution, test it, find out it's not perfect, and then make it better. This cycle keeps repeating until you get it right.
* Here's an example of how this process might work:
  * You notice a problem: "Houses use too much energy for heating and cooling."
  * You think about the science behind it: "Heat moves from warm places to cold places. Some materials transfer heat more easily than others."
  * You come up with a solution: "Let's design new insulation materials that don't let heat move through easily."
  * You test your solution in real houses, see how well it works, and keep improving it.

4. **Building Up Applied Sciences**: When we break down applied sciences to these basic ideas, we can see a few important things:
* Applied sciences are all about solving problems. Unlike basic sciences, which are driven by curiosity ("How does this work?"), applied sciences are driven by need ("How can we make this better?").
* Applied sciences often use knowledge from many different areas of science. To solve a real-world problem, you might need to understand physics, chemistry, and biology all at once.
* In applied sciences, you're always checking to see if your solution actually works in the real world. If it doesn't work perfectly, you keep tweaking and improving it.

In simple terms, applied sciences are about taking what we've learned from studying nature and using that knowledge to make useful things or solve practical problems. It's science in action, working to improve our everyday lives.
