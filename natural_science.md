# Natural Science

### What is Natural Science?

At its core:

> Natural science is the study of the natural world — everything in the universe that behaves according to natural laws.

That includes things like:

* Matter and energy (physics)
* Living organisms (biology)
* Earth and its systems (geology, meteorology)
* Atoms and chemical interactions (chemistry)

Natural science is **empirical**, meaning it’s based on observation, experimentation, and evidence.

### First Principles Thinking — Break It Down

Let’s now reduce it to the most fundamental truths:

**First Principle 1: Reality exists**.

There is a universe — something rather than nothing. It has structure, patterns, and behavior we can observe.

**First Principle 2: The universe follows consistent laws**.

Natural phenomena behave in consistent ways — things don’t randomly float, disappear, or defy logic. Gravity pulls things down. Water boils at 100°C (at sea level). These are laws, not guesses.

**First Principle 3: Humans can observe and understand the universe**.

We have senses, tools (like microscopes or telescopes), and brains that let us make sense of what's out there.

**First Principle 4: Knowledge comes from evidence**.

We learn by:

* Observing (what happens?)
* Hypothesizing (why might it happen?)
* Testing (does the idea hold up?)
* Repeating (does it *always* happen this way?)

This is the **scientific method** in action — the tool of natural science.

### Building Up from First Principles

Using those building blocks, natural science becomes:

> A systematic way of understanding how the natural world works — using observation, experimentation, and reasoning — grounded in the idea that the universe follows consistent laws that we can discover and understand.

### Natural Science in Action

It divides into major branches, all applying the same core logic:

* **Physics** – studies matter, energy, and fundamental forces.
* **Chemistry** – studies substances, their properties, and reactions.
* **Biology** – studies life and living organisms.
* **Earth Sciences** – studies Earth systems like rocks, oceans, weather, and climate.
* **Astronomy** – studies the universe beyond Earth.

Each of these builds models, makes predictions, and helps us shape technology, medicine, and our understanding of life itself.
