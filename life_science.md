## Life Science

### What is Life Science?

At its core, **life science is the study of life**. That means it's concerned with:

* What life *is*
* How life *works*
* How life *interacts* with the environment

### Step-by-Step Breakdown Using First Principles Thinking

**1. Start with the question: "What is life?"**

Before we can understand life science, we have to understand life itself.

**First principles of life** (things that are always true for living things):

* Made of cells
* Can grow and reproduce
* Use energy (metabolism)
* Respond to their environment
* Maintain internal stability (homeostasis)
* Evolve over generations

**Conclusion**: Life is a system of organized matter that sustains and reproduces itself using energy and genetic information.

**2. What is science?**

**First principle**: Science is a method to discover reliable knowledge about the world through **observation**, **experimentation**, and **logical reasoning**.

**3. Put it together: What is life science?**

> Life science is the systematic study of living systems — how they are built, how they function, how they change, and how they relate to each other and to their environment.

### Digging Deeper from First Principles

Let’s break life science down even further:

**1. What are living systems made of?**

* **Cells** (basic unit of life)
* Cells are made of **molecules** (like proteins, lipids, DNA)
* Molecules are made of **atoms**

**First principle**: At its root, biology is built on **chemistry**, which is built on **physics** — the behavior of matter and energy.

**2. How do living systems function?**

* Through chemical reactions (metabolism)
* Information flow (DNA → RNA → Protein)
* Coordination of processes (like brain signals or hormones)

**First principle**: Life is information-driven chemistry happening in a self-sustaining system.

**3. How do living systems change and evolve?**

* Random genetic mutations
* Natural selection
* Adaptation to environment

**First principle**: Life evolves over time through variation and selection.

### Summary in One Line:

**Life science = understanding how organized systems of matter (living things) use energy and information to survive, reproduce, and evolve.
