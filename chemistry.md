## Chemistry

Chemistry is the study of matter - everything that has mass and takes up space - and how it changes. To understand chemistry from first principles, we need to start with the building blocks of matter and work our way up to more complex interactions.

At the most fundamental level, all matter is made up of atoms. Atoms themselves consist of three key components: protons (positively charged), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (negatively charged). The protons and neutrons form the nucleus, while electrons orbit around it in specific energy levels.

The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines which element it is. This is called the atomic number. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton, helium has 2, and carbon has 6. This gives rise to the periodic table - a systematic organization of all known elements based on their atomic structure.

The way atoms interact is governed by their electron configurations. Electrons occupy different energy levels or "shells" around the nucleus, and atoms generally seek to achieve stable electron configurations by sharing, gaining, or losing electrons. This fundamental principle drives chemical bonding.

Chemical bonding occurs in several ways:
1. Ionic bonding - when electrons are transferred between atoms (like in table salt, NaCl)
2. Covalent bonding - when atoms share electrons (like in water, H2O)
3. Metallic bonding - when electrons are shared across many atoms in a metal structure

These bonds lead to the formation of molecules and compounds. The properties of these larger structures emerge from the underlying atomic interactions. For instance, water's unique properties (surface tension, ability to dissolve many substances) come from its molecular structure and the hydrogen bonding between molecules.

Chemical reactions occur when bonds between atoms break and reform to create new substances. These reactions follow fundamental principles:
- Conservation of mass (matter cannot be created or destroyed)
- Conservation of energy (energy can change forms but cannot be created or destroyed)
- Electron transfer or sharing must result in stable configurations

Understanding these basic principles allows us to predict and explain more complex chemical phenomena, from why rust forms on iron to how our bodies process nutrients. Every chemical process, whether in industrial manufacturing or biological systems, ultimately comes down to these fundamental interactions between atoms and molecules.
