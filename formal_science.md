# **Formal Sciences**

1. **What science is at its core**: Science is a way of learning about the world around us. It involves carefully studying things, coming up with ideas to explain what we see, and then testing those ideas to see if they're right.

2. **Different types of science**: There are sciences that study the physical world by doing experiments and observing things. These include studying nature (like biology or physics) and studying how people behave (like psychology or sociology). Then there are formal sciences, which are different because they don't rely on experiments or observations of the real world.

3. **What formal sciences are made of**: Formal sciences use made-up systems of symbols and rules, kind of like very complex games. They use careful step-by-step thinking to figure things out, rather than looking at the real world.

4. **Examples of formal sciences**: Math is a formal science - it uses numbers and shapes to figure things out without needing to measure real objects. Logic is another - it's about figuring out if an argument makes sense, using special symbols and rules. Computer science (the theoretical part) is also a formal science, studying how to process information and solve problems using abstract ideas rather than actual computers.

5. **Why formal sciences are useful**: Formal sciences help create tools that other sciences use. For example, physics uses math to describe how things move. Formal sciences also help make sure that ideas in other sciences make logical sense.

6. **How formal sciences are different**: Unlike other sciences, formal sciences don't need to do experiments or observe the real world. They work things out just by thinking carefully about the rules of their made-up systems. This means that what they figure out is always true within that system, no matter what happens in the real world.

In simple terms, formal sciences are like creating and exploring imaginary worlds with strict rules. By carefully thinking through these rules, we can discover truths that are always correct within that world. These truths and the ways of thinking used to find them often turn out to be very useful when trying to understand our real world too.
