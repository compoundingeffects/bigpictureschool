## Space Science

### What is *space science*?

At its core, **space science** is the study of **everything beyond Earth’s atmosphere**. It seeks to understand:

* **What’s out there** (planets, stars, galaxies, black holes, etc.)
* **How it works** (physics, chemistry, motion, etc.)
* **Where it came from** and **where it’s going**

Space science includes fields like:

* **Astronomy** – study of celestial objects and the universe
* **Astrophysics** – the physics of those objects
* **Planetary science** – study of planets, including Earth-like worlds
* **Cosmology** – study of the origin and fate of the universe
* **Astrobiology** – search for life beyond Earth

### First principles — what are the absolute basics?

Let’s strip it all down to fundamental truths:

#### 1. **We exist.**

We are conscious beings who can observe and ask questions.

#### 2. **We live on Earth.**

Earth is a physical object in a larger environment. This environment is called **space**.

#### 3. **The universe behaves in patterns.**

Everything from falling apples to orbiting planets follows **natural laws** — like gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces.

#### 4. **Light travels from space to Earth.**

We see stars because **light** (or other signals like radio waves) travels across vast distances.

#### 5. **We can measure and test.**

Using instruments like telescopes, satellites, and probes, we can collect data and test ideas about space.

### Build upward — what questions naturally arise?

From those basic truths, we start asking deeper questions:

* **What is the universe made of?**
* **Why do planets move the way they do?**
* **How did stars and galaxies form?**
* **Is there life elsewhere?**
* **What came before the Big Bang?**

And to answer these, we need:

* **Physics** to describe how forces and energy work
* **Math** to model and predict motion and change
* **Chemistry** to explain how atoms and molecules behave
* **Engineering** to build tools that explore space

### Summary

**Space science**, from first principles, is the systematic attempt to understand the universe using fundamental laws of nature. We start with what we know for sure — that we can observe, measure, and reason — and we use those tools to decode the mysteries of space.
