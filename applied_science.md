# **Applied Science**

1. **What is applied science**? Applied science is about using scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems. It takes the understanding we get from basic science and uses it in practical ways. This often leads to new technology, better medical treatments, and improved engineering solutions.

2. **What is science**? Science is a way of studying the world around us to understand how things work. Scientists do this by:
    - Watching things carefully (observation)
    - Guessing why things happen (making hypotheses)
    - Testing their guesses (experimentation)
    - Thinking about the results and improving their ideas (analysis and refinement)

    There are two main types of science:
    - **Pure science**: This is about learning new things just to understand them better.
    - **Applied science**: This is about using what we've learned to solve problems or make useful things.

3. **What is application**? In science, application means using scientific knowledge to solve a specific problem or meet a particular need. The steps for this are:
- Figure out what problem needs solving
- Understand which scientific ideas can help
- Come up with a solution using those ideas
- Test the solution and make it better

4. **Fields of applied science**: Applied science is used in many different areas:
- **Engineering**: Uses math and physics to design and build things like bridges and machines.
- **Medicine**: Uses biology and chemistry to understand diseases and find ways to treat them.
- **Environmental Science**: Uses knowledge about nature to solve environmental problems.
- **Agriculture**: Uses biology to grow food better and more sustainably.

5. **The relationship between pure and applied science**: Pure science asks "Why?" while applied science asks "How can we use this?" For example:
- Pure science might study how very tiny particles behave (quantum mechanics).
- Applied science might use that knowledge to build better computers or medical equipment.

6. **First principles of innovation in applied science**: When trying to solve a problem with applied science, the steps are:
- Identify the problem that needs solving
- Figure out which scientific ideas can help
- Design a solution using those ideas
- Test and improve the solution for real-world use

7. **The role of technology**: Technology is often the result of applied science. It's the practical tool or system that comes from using scientific knowledge. For example:
- Understanding electricity (pure science) led to creating electrical devices (applied science and technology).
- Learning about diseases (pure science) helped create vaccines (applied science and technology).

8. **Scientific method in applied science**: Applied science follows a process similar to regular science, but focuses on solving practical problems:
- Notice a problem that needs solving.
- Suggest how science might solve it.
- Test the idea by building prototypes or running simulations.
- Put the solution to use in the real world.
- Keep improving the solution based on how well it works.
