# Physics

## What is physics?

Physics is all about figuring out how the universe works. It asks the big questions: Why do things move the way they do? What makes stuff behave the way it does? And are there basic rules that everything follows?

## Starting with what we can see

Physics begins with simple things we notice every day. Drop something, and it falls to the ground. Shine a light, and it travels in a straight line. Your hot coffee cools down. Magnets stick to your refrigerator. These everyday observations are where physics starts.

But then physicists look closer at these observations and notice patterns. That apple you dropped? It falls at exactly the same speed as a bowling ball (if you ignore air resistance). Light always travels at the same speed through empty space—nothing goes faster. Heat always moves from hot things to cold things, never the other way around. Energy changes form—like when you convert electricity into light—but it never just vanishes.

These patterns hint that there are rules underneath it all, like a hidden instruction manual for how nature works.

## Why measurement and math matter

What makes physics different from just noticing things is that it measures everything precisely and describes it with math. Instead of saying "that ball is falling fast," physics says exactly how fast and predicts where it will be at any moment.

Math becomes the language of physics because it's the best tool for describing patterns. When something changes over time—like a car speeding up—we need math to capture exactly how quickly that change happens. When things move in waves—like sound or ocean swells—we need math to describe their ups and downs. The math can get complicated, but it's always trying to describe something real that's happening in the world.

## The rules that never break

Through centuries of careful observation, physicists have discovered certain rules that never seem to break. These are called conservation laws, and they're some of the deepest truths we know about reality.

Here's what they tell us. Energy never disappears—it just changes form. When you burn gasoline in a car, the chemical energy becomes motion, heat, and sound, but the total amount of energy stays the same. Similarly, in any closed system (meaning nothing from outside interferes), the total "oomph" of moving objects—what physicists call momentum—stays constant. If two pool balls collide, whatever momentum one ball loses, the other gains.

These unbreakable rules tell us something profound: certain aspects of the universe are fundamental and unchanging. They put limits on what can possibly happen, which helps us understand what will happen.

## Forces: why things change

Things don't just start moving on their own—something has to push or pull them. These pushes and pulls are what we call forces. Through careful study, physicists have found that every single interaction in the universe comes down to just four fundamental forces:

- **Gravity** pulls objects with mass toward each other—it keeps your feet on the ground and Earth orbiting the Sun.
- **Electromagnetism** is responsible for electricity, magnets, light, and the forces that hold molecules together.
- **The strong nuclear force** glues the centers of atoms together.
- **The weak nuclear force** is involved in certain types of radioactive decay.

That's it. Everything that happens—from galaxies colliding to proteins folding in your cells—comes down to these four forces.

## The weird reality beneath everyday experience

When physicists looked really closely at how nature works, they discovered some truly strange things that don't match our everyday experience.

For one, tiny things like electrons aren't exactly particles or waves—they're somehow both, depending on how you look at them. It's like asking whether light is a spray of pellets or a flowing wave: the answer is "yes."

Space and time aren't separate things—they're woven together, and massive objects like stars actually bend this fabric, which is what we experience as gravity.

At the tiniest scales, nature doesn't work like clockwork. You can't predict exactly what an individual atom will do, only the probability of different outcomes. It's as if nature is playing dice, though the odds are precisely determined.

These discoveries sound bizarre, but they emerged from following the evidence wherever it led. Sometimes reality is stranger than our intuition suggests.

## Why physics works: the power of prediction

The real proof that physics understands something comes from prediction. If you truly understand the rules, you can predict what will happen in situations you've never seen before.

This is why we have working technology. GPS satellites, for example, have to account for the fact that time runs slightly differently in space than on Earth (one of those weird predictions from physics about space and time being connected). Quantum computers work by harnessing the strange probabilistic behavior of tiny particles. Bridges stand up because engineers can predict exactly how forces will distribute through steel and concrete.

Physics, then, is humanity's systematic project to understand reality. It starts with simple observations, finds patterns, describes them mathematically, and builds toward universal principles that explain everything from the smallest atoms to the largest galaxies. And crucially, it always checks its ideas against the real world, making sure that beautiful theories actually match what nature does.
