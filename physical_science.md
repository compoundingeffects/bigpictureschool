## Physical Science

### What is Physical Science?

**Physical science** is the branch of science that studies **non-living systems**—specifically, the **laws and properties of matter, energy, space, and time**. It's the foundation of how the physical universe behaves.

It includes four main areas:

1. **Physics** – study of matter, energy, motion, and forces.
2. **Chemistry** – study of the composition, structure, and reactions of matter.
3. **Astronomy** – study of space, celestial bodies, and the universe.
4. **Earth science** – study of Earth's physical structure and processes (like geology, meteorology, oceanography).

### First Principles Thinking: Starting From Scratch

Let’s now rebuild physical science from the ground up using first principles.

**Step 1: What is the universe made of?**

**First principle:**
Everything we can observe or measure is made of **matter** and affected by **energy**.

* **Matter** = stuff (atoms, molecules)
* **Energy** = ability to cause change (movement, heat, light)

So, the universe is made of things (matter) that interact and change (energy).

**Step 2: How do we study these things?**

We use:

* **Observation** (see what happens)
* **Measurement** (quantify things: how much, how fast, how hot, etc.)
* **Experimentation** (test ideas by changing variables and seeing results)

This is the **scientific method**. It's how we systematically understand physical science.

**Step 3: What rules govern matter and energy?**

Now we start to build laws and theories.

* **Physics** discovers rules like Newton's Laws (motion), conservation of energy, gravity, etc.
* **Chemistry** explains how atoms bond, how reactions work, and why materials behave differently.
* **Astronomy** applies physics to stars, planets, and galaxies.
* **Earth science** applies these ideas to the planet—weather, rocks, oceans, and more.

These fields describe **what happens**, **why it happens**, and **how it happens**.

**Step 4: Why does this matter?**

Because **everything physical**—from smartphones to stars, volcanoes to vaccines—follows these rules. Physical science is the **toolbox** that lets us:

* Build technology
* Understand nature
* Predict weather
* Send rockets to Mars
* Cure diseases (through chemistry, physics in MRI machines, etc.)

### Summary (First Principles Style)

* **Reality is made of matter and energy**
* **Matter and energy follow consistent, discoverable rules**
* **We use observation and experiments to figure out those rules**
* **The study of these rules = physical science**
