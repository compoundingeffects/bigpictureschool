## Cellular Biology

1. **What is cellular biology**? Cellular biology is the study of cells, which are the smallest living things that make up all life. It looks at how cells work, how they interact with each other, and how they make more of themselves. Basically, it's about understanding the tiniest parts of life and how they function.

2. **What is life**? Life is what makes living things different from non-living things. Living things can grow, make more of themselves, react to their surroundings, keep themselves stable, and change to fit their environment better. At its most basic, life happens because of chemical reactions in cells, following instructions stored in DNA.

3. **What is a cell**? A cell is the smallest thing that can be alive on its own. There are two main types: simple ones without a center (like bacteria) and complex ones with a center (like the cells in plants and animals). Cells have a protective outer layer, a jelly-like inside, and special parts that do specific jobs. Complex cells also have a control center where the DNA is kept and parts that make energy.

4. **What are cells made of**? Cells are made of very small things called molecules, which are made of even smaller things called atoms. The most important molecules for life are:
- **Proteins**: These do most of the work in cells.
- **Lipids**: These make up the cell's outer layer.
- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy and structure.
- **Nucleic acids**: These store and pass on instructions for how the cell should work.

5. **How do cells get energy**? Cells need energy to do things like move, grow, and make more cells. They get energy in two main ways:
- By breaking down food (like sugar) with oxygen to make energy.
- In plant cells, by using sunlight to make food and energy.

6. **How do cells reproduce**? Cells make more of themselves in two ways:
- **Regular division**: A cell splits into two identical copies.
- **Special division**: This makes cells for reproduction (like eggs and sperm) with half the usual genetic material.

7. **How do cells communicate**? Cells talk to each other to work together. They do this by:
- Having special parts on their surface that can detect messages.
- When a message is received, it causes changes inside the cell that make the cell do something in response.

8. **How is information stored in cells**? Cells store information in DNA, which is like a set of instructions for building and running a living thing. DNA is made of four building blocks arranged in a specific order. This information is used to make proteins, which do most of the work in cells. The process goes like this: DNA makes RNA, and RNA is used to make proteins.
